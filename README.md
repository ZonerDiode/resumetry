## Project Overview
ResumeTry is an Angular 20 web application with a FastAPI Python serverless backend using Pydantic for model validation to handle API requests.

### What it does
- Track Job Applications that are submitted to companies.
- Track Status changes that occur over time (Applied, Screen, Interview, Offer, Rejected, Withdrawl, Ghosted).
- Track Notes about things that happen to Job Applications.

### Currently in Construction
- This application is rapidly changing to become the one source of tracking Applications that I am submitting to companies.
- I will be updating it until it is in a generally GOOD usable state.
